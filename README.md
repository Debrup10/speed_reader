## Basic Readme
## Let's build an app to help students read faster.
## To do that, we would be using python and streamlit (for UI)
#### Step 1: clone the git repo to your local
#### Step 2: install the required libraries(pip install -r requirement.txt)
#### Step 3: run the streamlit app (streamlit run speed_reader.py)
